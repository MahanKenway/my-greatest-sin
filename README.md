# My Greatest Sin

> **A dual-species connectome observation bench for separating source data, explicit modelling, and honest uncertainty.**

**My Greatest Sin** is a browser-first React, Babylon.js and TypeScript project for studying bounded sensorimotor hypotheses around adult *Drosophila* FlyWire data and the *C. elegans* connectome. It is not a claim that a living animal, awareness, whole-body control, or biologically validated walking has been recreated.

## Scientific status

| System | Source topology | What currently executes | What remains modelled or blocked |
|---|---:|---|---|
| *C. elegans* | 279 neurons / 6,261 edges | Checksum-verified source topology runs in the browser | Sensor routing, motor grouping and the body wave are `MODELLED MAPPING` |
| FlyWire v783 | 139,255 proofread roots / 16,847,997 connection rows | Official data, CSR derivatives, site-level sign extraction and bounded offline corridors are verified outside the repository | `GameWorld` remains **0 N / 0 E** until a valid WebGPU run and separate scientific validation pass |
| Fly body | Apache-2.0 source derivative with real presentation pivots | Garden presentation and isolated mouthpart rig | Gait, wings, root movement and all displayed body output remain modelled; no FlyWire result controls them |

The current browser exposes `navigator.gpu`, but the target environment rejects `requestAdapter()`. The application therefore blocks real FlyWire execution rather than inventing a CPU fallback, a timing value, neural activity, or body command.

## What has been validated

The project stores raw FlyWire v783 files and derived binary packs **outside this repository**. Downloaded official inputs, chunk manifests, site-level transmitter predictions, annotation releases and output reports carry checksums and provenance. JavaScript FlyWire root IDs remain strings or `BigInt`; they are never converted to unsafe `Number` values.

Three bounded, offline LIF investigations use official v783 structure, site-level neuron signs and the published Shiu model constants. They are scientific **structural-model validations**, not animal recordings or full-brain results.

| Input population | Bounded corridor to MN9 | Offline outcome | Interpretation boundary |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Right labellar sugar GRNs | 1,115 nodes / 13,346 edges | Modelled MN9 response rises across the protocol; input-ablation is zero | Modelled Poisson input and Forward-Euler solver; not a FlyBody command |
| Right labellar water GRNs | 961 nodes / 11,231 edges | Distinct modelled MN9 response; input-ablation is zero | Same bounded approximation; not water perception or drinking |
| Right Johnston-organ JO-A mechanoreceptors | 787 nodes / 5,741 edges | MN9 is zero at all tested rates | A limited negative result for this selected auditory/mechanosensory corridor only |

The selected **sugar-GRN → MN9 / proboscis** pilot is the first embodiment target because its feeding circuit has a better documented FlyWire boundary than descending-neuron-dependent locomotion. Food encoding and MN9-to-mouthpart conversion are visibly labelled `MODELLED SENSOR INPUT` and `MODELLED MOTOR DECODER`; walking, wings and root movement are excluded by design.

## Architecture

```text
Official FlyWire v783 / pinned annotations
        │  checksums + version pinning
        ▼
External binary DFLY packs and site-level artifacts
        │
        ├── Browser: integrity-gated WebGPU benchmark → currently adapter-blocked
        └── Offline/server research: bounded signed corridor → LIF protocol → raw reports
                                                            │
                                                            └── never feeds FlyBody automatically
```

The production UI is static. A future server-side path should keep large immutable columns in object storage, run experiments in a GPU worker, record seeds/checksums/versions through a small API, and return only experiment results to the UI. A relational database such as Neon may catalogue runs and metadata; it is not a GPU simulator.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22 and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

For a production bundle:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

The app can be opened in a modern browser. WebGPU must provide a genuine adapter before any official FlyWire GPU execution is allowed. The UI always displays whether a result is source-derived, modelled, staged, blocked or a synthetic numerical fixture.

## Data workflow

Do not place raw FlyWire data in `client/public`, the project tree, or Git history. The project provides external-only processing tools under [`scripts/data-processing`](scripts/data-processing), including:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `download_flywire_v783_official.sh` | Resumable official connectivity download with published MD5 verification |
| `download_flywire_v783_site_level.sh` | Official site-level table containing cleft scores and transmitter predictions |
| `build_flywire_v783_pack.py` | Builds checksum-bearing CSR packs outside the repository |
| `build_flywire_v783_neuron_signs.py` | Derives neuron-level excitatory/inhibitory signs from site-level data under the documented rule |
| `extract_sugar_mn9_four_hop_corridor.py` | Extracts bounded source-structural corridors to MN9 |
| `run_sugar_mn9_offline_subgraph_lif.py` | Runs a seeded offline LIF protocol without touching `GameWorld` |
| `run_v783_corridor_brian2cuda.py` | CUDA-only prototype using the reference Brian2 equations; it has no CPU fallback |

Every experimental report must retain the source release, annotation revision, input checksum, code revision, random seed, trial count and explicit modelling assumptions.

## Research roadmap

The next credible milestones are annotation-pinned labellar/pharyngeal mechanoreceptors, a separately documented olfactory population, a GPU worker run using Brian2CUDA on compatible NVIDIA hardware, and an independent comparison against the reference Brian2 integration. Full-body locomotion remains a later and harder question because relevant descending-neuron pathways are incomplete in FlyWire.
